## How to Test Offline Functionality

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Main Dashboard: http://localhost:5000/master
   - Wizard: http://localhost:5000/wizard
   - Analytics: http://localhost:5000/analytics
   - Calendar: http://localhost:5000/calendar

3. **Test online features first:**
   - Create ship operations via wizard
   - Upload and process documents
   - View analytics charts
   - Check calendar scheduling

4. **Test offline functionality:**
   - Disconnect internet
   - Reload pages (should work from cache)
   - Try to create operations (should queue)
   - View cached data
   - Reconnect internet and watch queued operations process

## Expected Offline Behavior

- **Service Worker:** Caches all static resources and API responses
- **Local Storage:** Saves ships data, analytics, and settings
- **Operation Queue:** Stores failed operations to retry when online
- **Offline Indicators:** Shows warnings when using cached/sample data
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works offline
